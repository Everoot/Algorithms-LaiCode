#Reverse Linked List In Pairs

LeetCode 24 Swap Nodes in Pairs

Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head. You must solve the problem without modifying the values in the list's nodes (i.e., only nodes themselves may be changed.)



**Example 1:**

Lai Code 35 Reverse Linked List In Pairs 

Reverse pairs of elements in a singly-linked list.

**Examples**

- L = null, after reverse is null
- L = 1 -> null, after reverse is 1 -> null
- L = 1 -> 2 -> null, after reverse is 2 -> 1 -> null
- L = 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> null, after reverse is 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> null
